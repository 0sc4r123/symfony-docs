Upgrading
=========

So a new Symfony release has come out and you want to upgrade, great! Fortunately,
because Symfony protects backwards-compatibility very closely, this *should*
be quite easy.

There are three types of upgrades, all needing a little different preparation:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    /upgrade/patch_version
    /upgrade/minor_version
    /upgrade/major_version
    /upgrade/bundles
