Symfony2 Twig Extensions
========================

Twig is the default template engine for Symfony2. It contains a lot of build-in
functions, filters and blocks. Symfony2 created some custom extension on
top of Twig to integrate some components into the Twig templates.

Below is information about all the custom functions, filters and blocks
that are defined by the Symfony2 Core Framework. There may also be tags
in bundles that are included within the Symfony Standard Edition, or in
bundles you use, that aren't listed here.
