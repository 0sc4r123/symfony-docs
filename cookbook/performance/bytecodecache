Using a byte code cache
=======================

In order to get optimal performance from Symfony2 it is recommended to use a
so called byte code cache. The idea of a byte code cache is to remove the need
to constantly recompile the PHP source code. There are a number of
`byte code caches`_ available, some of which are open source.

Further optimizations
---------------------

Byte code caches usually monitor the source files for changes. This ensures that
if the source file changes, the byte code is recompiled automatically. However
this obviously adds overhead.

Some byte code caches offer a mode for this reason that does not do these checks.
Obviously when enabling this mode it will be up to the server admin to ensure
that the cache is cleared if source files change.

To enable this mode in APC simple add ``apc.stat=0'' to your php.ini configuration.
